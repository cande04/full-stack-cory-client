Cory's Full Stack Project - Client

## What is it?
For those who love food and eat out A LOT but have trouble keeping track of where and what they ate, this application can help! More Food For Thought is a personal tracker for restaurants and food. Each user can input a restaurant and log the food they ate as well as any relevant notes. At any point, they can dishes to restaurants and modify the data as needed.

## Back-end

## List of Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Handlebars
- jQuery
- Javascript

## Planning
My plan for this project was to start with the basics - I knew I needed a way to collect user information and restaurant data as well as means to display the data. I created simple forms and utilized Bootstrap for aesthetics.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to document the restaurant, dish, and city
- As a user, I want to see my favorite restaurants in a particular city
- As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete a restaurant and/or meal
- As a user, I want to search for a specific restaurant to see what I ate there
- As a user, I want a log in so all my restaurant data is stored and retrievable
- As a user, I want to see when I ate at that particular restaurant

## Development and Problem Solving
One of the biggest obstacles I faced in this project was familiarizing myself with Handlebars. I read a few tutorials online and looked up specific questions I had prior to beginning and eventually found Handlebars to be very valuable in looping through and displaying data.

## Future Iterations
For future iterations, I would like to better organize and display the restaurants - it would be nice to be able to organize them by location, or include a date field to indicate when the user ate at the restaurant.
